Title: Challenges Faced by Job Seekers in Navigating Online Recruitment Platforms
Background of the Study:
In today’s digital era, online recruitment platforms such as Jobberman, LinkedIn, and company
career portals have become vital tools for connecting employers with potential employees.
These platforms are designed to simplify the job application process, increase transparency,
and broaden access to employment opportunities. However, many job seekers still encounter
various difficulties when applying through these systems. Common challenges include
technical issues, poor platform usability, lack of feedback mechanisms, data privacy concerns,
and complex application procedures. Understanding these challenges is essential for improving
the efficiency and inclusiveness of digital recruitment systems.
Statement of the Problem:
Even while online recruitment platforms are convenient, job seekers frequently find it difficult
to effectively finish applications or receive prompt responses from firms. Technical glitches,
unclear instructions, poor internet connectivity, and system design flaws have discouraged
many qualified candidates from utilizing these platforms effectively. These issues raise
questions about whether online recruitment platforms actually achieve their goal of making it
easier to find jobs.
Purpose of the Study:
The purpose of this research is to analyze the key challenges faced by job seekers when
navigating online recruitment platforms, and to provide recommendations for improving user
experience and platform effectiveness.
Objectives of the Study:
1. To identify the common technical and usability challenges faced by job seekers on
recruitment platforms.
2. To examine the extent to which user interface design affects job seekers’ application
experience.
3. To assess how feedback and communication mechanisms influence applicant
satisfaction.
4. To propose strategies for improving accessibility and efficiency of online recruitment
platforms.
Research Questions:
1. What are the main challenges job seekers encounter on online recruitment platforms?
2. How does the design and functionality of these platforms affect the application process?
3. What role does feedback and employer communication play in applicants’ satisfaction?
4. What improvements can be made to enhance users’ experiences on recruitment
platforms?
Research Method:
The study will adopt a descriptive survey design. Data will be collected using a structured
questionnaire administered to job seekers who have applied for positions through online
recruitment platforms within the past 12 months. The questionnaire will include closed ended
questions to capture quantitative insights.
Significance of the Study:
The findings will provide valuable information to recruitment platform developers, HR
professionals, and HR policymakers to improve digital recruitment systems and enhance job
seekers’ experiences.
